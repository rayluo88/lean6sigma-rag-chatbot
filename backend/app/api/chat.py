'''Chat API endpoints for RAG-based chatbot.

This module provides an endpoint for processing user queries.
User query is augmented with context from the Lean Six Sigma knowledge base,
and a response is generated using a simulated OpenAI API call.
Chat interactions are stored in the database for analytics.
