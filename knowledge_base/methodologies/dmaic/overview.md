# DMAIC Methodology

## Overview

DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes. It is an integral part of Six Sigma methodology, but can be implemented as a standalone quality improvement procedure.

## Content

### Define Phase
- Identify the problem
- Define project goals
- Map the process
- Create project charter
- Identify stakeholders

### Measure Phase
- Develop data collection plan
- Collect baseline data
- Validate measurement system
- Begin to quantify the problem

### Analyze Phase
- Identify root causes
- Validate hypothesis
- Determine process capability
- Identify value/non-value added process steps

### Improve Phase
- Develop potential solutions
- Select the best solution
- Implement pilot program
- Verify improvement
- Implement full-scale

### Control Phase
- Develop control plan
- Document procedures
- Monitor the process
- Verify long-term success

## Best Practices

1. Use data-driven decision making
2. Involve stakeholders throughout the process
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate improvements with statistical analysis
5. Ensure sustainable results through proper control measures

## Common Tools Used
